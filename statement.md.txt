Problem Statement

In an increasingly digital world, users are required to manage dozens of unique and complex passwords across various online services. Storing these credentials in insecure methods, such as handwritten notes, unencrypted spreadsheets, or browser-saved passwords, poses a significant **security risk** and leads to password fatigue (reusing simple passwords). The problem is to create a secure, accessible, and easy-to-use local application that simplifies password management while guaranteeing data security through strong encryption.

  Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to develop a functional, command-line interface (CLI) application with a focus on local security and data handling.

 In Scope:
CLI Interface:** All interaction will be via the terminal (command-line).
Local Persistence:** Data (encrypted passwords) and the encryption key will be stored locally in files (`passwords.json` and `key.key`).
Core CRUD Functionality:** Implement features to Create, Retrieve, Update, and List saved credentials.
Strong Encryption:** Utilization of the `cryptography.fernet` module for robust, symmetric encryption of all stored passwords.

 Out of Scope (Future Enhancements):
 Graphical User Interface (GUI) development (e.g., using Tkinter or PyQt).
 Online synchronization or cloud storage capabilities.
 Integration with external password generation tools.
 Master password hashing and authentication (currently only focuses on encryption key management).


  Target Users

This application is designed for users who prioritize **data security** and prefer lightweight, self-contained tools without relying on commercial cloud services.

Individual Developers:** Those who need a quick and secure tool for managing development environment credentials and API keys.
Privacy-Conscious Individuals:** Users who are uncomfortable storing sensitive data in third-party or browser-based managers.
Students and Learners:** Individuals learning Python and cybersecurity fundamentals who need a practical project demonstrating encryption and file handling.
